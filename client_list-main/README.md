## Reminders

- Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
- Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
- Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

# Client List App

The purpose of this app is to allow a trainer to access their list of clients for running training. The user i.e. the trainer, can add new clients, view clients, edit clients' information and delete clients, as needed. There are also automated calculations done on the input data to determine the training needs of the client which will assist the trainer in making a training plan. It is assumed that a new client has previous running experience and is hiring this trainer to improve their running time, therefore all inputs must be completed.

## Future Features

- to allow for clients with no previous running experience
- to create options for other sports such as cycling, swimming, weight-lifting depending on the trainer's area of expertise

## Technologies

- PyInputPlus module
